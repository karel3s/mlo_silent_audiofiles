# How to use

If you don't like your MyLifeOrganized workflow to be disturbed by interface sounds, here's a script to generate silent audiofiles to replace the default sounds.

You can also just copy/paste the files from the /output folder in this repo to "C:\Program Files (x86)\MyLifeOrganized.net\MLO\Sound".

Remember, you need to overwrite the files after every update or reinstall.

Enjoy the silenceðŸ˜‰!
