# How to use

If you don't like your MyLifeOrganized workflow to be disturbed by interface sounds, here's a script to generate silent audiofiles to replace the default sounds.

You can also copy/paste the files from the output folder to "C:\Program Files (x86)\MyLifeOrganized.net\MLO\Sound".

Remember to overwrite the files after every update or reinstall.

Enjoy the silenceðŸ˜‰!
